## Student Maths Score Prediction

## Introduction
1) Problem statement
This project understands how the student's performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch and Test preparation course.

2) Data Collection
Dataset Source - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977
The data consists of 8 column and 1000 rows.

## Dataset information
gender : sex of students -> (Male/female)
race/ethnicity : ethnicity of students -> (Group A, B,C, D,E)
parental level of education : parents' final education ->(bachelor's degree,some college,master's degree,associate's degree,high school)
lunch : having lunch before test (standard or free/reduced)
test preparation course : complete or not complete before test
math score
reading score
writing score

## Project Overview
In this project, different machine learning algorithms listed below are used.
### 1.Linear Regression
### 2.K-Neighbors Regressor
### 3.Decision Tree
### 4.Random Forest Regressor
### 5.XGBRegressor
### 6.CatBoosting Regressor
### 7.AdaBoost Regressor

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 88% on the test dataset. Linear Regreesion model is used for prediction.
